Update:

I've received news about the SMT exploit in this thread being used in an XDA-thread releasing tool without proper credit. My original purpose to share my research is to help the community to better utilize and protect their devices, and to help the vendors to improve device security, and to help other researchers for technical insights. I'm glad to see this research is given a new life, and helped someone else, further development are welcome - however it should be legal, non-profit, with proper attribution, and in good faith. Sorry to hear someone not obeying these principles.
